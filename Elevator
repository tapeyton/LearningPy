Extended response questions

# 1. What appeals to you about a role in ASIS? Or in what way do your values align with the values of ASIS and our mission? (maximum 500 words)

It is challenging to articulate the appeal towards a group of which little is known. As a recent graduate, the terms "training", "experiences", and "opportunities" come to mind, 
there is a desire to stretch myself and there is also, admittedly, an inherent desire to discover and unveil the unknown associated with ASIS.

From an altruistic and patriotic perspective, there has been an underlying desire to serve the country at some point. Initially, this lead me to investigate the merits of spending
time with the armed forces as I was coming towards the end of school (drawn towards the physical challenge that could provide) but my preference now lies with the intelligence ranks. 
This preference is driven by a considered reflection on where my strengths lie and, of the multiple intelligence agencies, I find that my skills and values best align with ASIS. 

On a personal note, I'm looking to build a strong set of skills during the infancy of my working life. I'm still searching for a genuine passion(s) to devote myself to, 
however my intention is to accumulate a broad range of skills, both technical and interpersonal, before applying these to an area that I am passionate about in the hope that I
will be able to provide maximum benefit to the given cause. It is clear that Intelligence Officers in ASIS must be very capable individuals, both technically and interpersonally, and 
hence one appeal of the role is personal and professional development. 


# 2. Discuss two influential experiences from your resume which you think make you a strong candidate for an Intelligence Officer. Why did you select these two experiences? (maximum 500 words)

The two resume items that most advance my prospects as a successful Intelligence Officer are: 
1) Involvement with Business Case Competitions
2) My role as a strategy analyst at PEXA

International Business Case competitions ask teams of four students to prepare a set of solutions to a proposed business problem over the course of 24 - 48 hrs before presenting 
to a panel of judges who conduct Q&A at the end of each teams' presentations. Time management is critical, as is team cohesion and communication throughout the entire preparation 
period. The international competitions I attended offered the chance to mingle with other students from around the world and this was a fascinating part of the trip as it
gave me an insight into various personalities and social norms of these representatives as we participated in activities in both the lead-up to the main event and in celebrations
afterwards. I made a number of connections with those I met, some of which I still interact with today. For the LA competition I was asked by the program co-ordinator to bring
cohesion and balance to the team as there was much tension over the summer training period between team members. This required me to work closely with the affected parties to 
build trust with them and ensure that I could rely on them to reason with me late at night whilst sleep-deprived and behind schedule. 

A recent performance review 

# 3. Describe your most rewarding professional achievement. What did you learn from this achievement? (maximum 500 words)

The most rewarding professional acheivement is a recent one - delivery of the "FY20 PEXA Emissions Report" which looks to estimate the emissions of CO2-equivalents by the business
for the past financial year. The report was motivated by the organisation celebrating 10 years since inception and wishing to calculate both the positive impact it's had on the
property industry and where it stands with current emissions, acknowledging the need to reduce its net footprint over time. It is significant because I see the environment as
under threat and it is important for individuals, businesses and governemnt to play a role in influencing the environment in a positive way. I view this report as a contribution
and the basis and motivation for proposing behaviour changes within the company. 

Key learnings centre around timetables and stakeholder management. After proposing a timetable to a senior member of my team, I realised that it was an unrealistic one that
didn't allow for major delays that were likely given the number of people involved. We altered the timeline and kept decision makers informed. I've since considered the use of
internal and external timetables to convey urgency and realism to different groups, while also noting the need to work more closely with my colleagues to ensure deadlines were 
met.

Practically speaking, I also obtained an estimate of what the company has saved the property industry since operations began in 2014 and the group's FY20 footprint. 


# 4. Provide an example of when you have had to think quickly on your feet and respond to a problem. (maximum 500 words)

Whilst travelling in Indonesia (Bali) at the start of 2017, I was driving a motorbike with my partner behind me as we returned from an alcohol-free lunch in busy Seminyak 
traffic when our holiday took a turn for the worst. 

I claim minimal experience on two wheels but a smooth 8hr journey on the same bike the day before to the southern coast of the island had (over) bouyed my confidence. 

On this day however, I misjudged my proximity to the footpath where other motorbikes were parked with their rear number plates facing the oncoming traffic. I heard a yell from
behind me and pulled over immediately - I looked down at the blood-covered thongs my partner was wearing and realised a number plate had sliced open the webbing between her 
third and fourth left toes. I parked the bike, sat her down on a nearby milk crate, sought the assistance of local strangers who offered bottled water and bandages to apply pressure
to the wound. 

In my frenzy and seeing my partner light-headed, I nominated two elderly ladies to take care of her whilst I sought out help from the hotel we were staying at 300m 
away from the incident site, remembering that they had medical personel on the premises. Ducking and weaving through foot-traffic, I reached the front desk and explained the
situation before returning to my partner to find that she was still conscious and being looked after by a group of kind-hearted shop owners. Within 5 mins a hotel ambulance / vehicles
had arrived at the site and then transported the two of us to the nearest hospital where we stayed for most of the night. 

My partner hobbled away with 17 stitches, internal and externalI and the rest of our holiday was much more subdued.
